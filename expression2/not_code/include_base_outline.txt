@name Include-Base guidelines v1

#All e2s made using this outline need to work flawlessly when included in other e2s using the #include directive
#All settings should be easily editable without the editing the main code of the e2

#[Functionals:
    -Clearly define where the editable constants begin and end
    -Avoid using entity directions such as entity():up(), entity():forward(), etc
    -Instead define directions as such: 
        ...Dir_FWD = vec(1, 0, 0)...
    -and use as such: 
        ...let Forward = entity:toLocalAxis(Dir_FWD)...
    -Do not hardcode sounds into functionality, instead make use of function variables.
    -Widely used non-default functions should have their own lib #include
    -Do not use @persist
    -Use @strict
    -Whilst the idea is to use @trigger none for everything, dont put it in the e2 includeable e2s, instead put it in the master include e2
]#   

#[Inputs:
    -@inputs names should be standardized across all e2s to avoid retreading the same ground
    -Naming scheme:
        -The main central prop = "Base"
        -Horizontal rotation turret = "Turret"
        -Vertical rotation turret = "Gun"
        -Pod Controller inputs should be named the same as they are on the Pod Controller
        -Cam Controller same as Pod Controller, or a wirelink
        -EGP wirelink = "EGP"
    -Avoid having many [ENTITY] inputs of the same function (eg. Turret1, Turret2, Turret3), instead opt to use the Advanced Entity Marker
]#

#[Code Style Guide:
    -Constants should be SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
    -Globals should be PascalCase
    -Locals should be Pascal_Snake_Case
    -Add spaces inbetween brackets and code on a 1-liner if statement, example:
        ...if(!Player:isValid){ exit() }...
    -Add spaces at the beginning and end of every math symbol
    -Avoid using 1 letter long variable names such as E, A, W, N, etc... Instead use context-appropriate variable names
    -Use "let" instead of "local"
    -Non-editable constants should use "const"
]#

#[Limitations:
    -Locals defined inside the main scope of the file do not work in events when included in another file
